### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Aleksander Krivosheev

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on SCADA Integrations Engineer

From relevant experience, there is a pet project called [bond_search_tool](https://github.com/Workbench3D/bond_search_tool).
The service consists of three interconnected components that automate the search and provision of information on profitable bonds using data from the MOEX.
